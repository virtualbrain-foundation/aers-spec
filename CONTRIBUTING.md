# CONTRIBUTING.md — AERS (Visionary + Strict Hybrid Governance)

Status: Experimental v0.x

## Governance Tone

Visionary + Strict Hybrid  
Designed for Humans, AI Agents, and Autonomous Contributors.

## Core Policies (Locked)

1. Spec Stability: A — Breaking changes allowed during v0.x (must be documented)
2. AI PR Policy: C — Autonomous merges allowed if validation passes
3. Conflict Authority: C — Governance repo arbitrates

## Doctrine

Contributions must preserve:

- Framework neutrality
- Vendor neutrality
- Cognition neutrality (symbolic, neural, hybrid)
- Robotics & space readiness
- Long-term auditability

## Allowed Contributions

- Spec evolution
- Ontology refinement
- Neutral schema extensions
- Interoperability design

## Not Allowed in Spec

- Framework-specific abstractions
- SDK logic
- Vendor integrations
- Product features

These belong in:

- aers-sdk
- aers-registry

## Autonomous Contributor Rules

AI agents must:

- Read AGENTS.md first
- Align with AI_CONTEXT.md
- Preserve ontology integrity
- Prefer minimal primitives

## Final Principle

Contribute as if shaping the cognitive DNA of future autonomous systems.
