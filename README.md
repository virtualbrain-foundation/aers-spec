# AERS — AI Execution Record Specification (Experimental v0.x)

AERS (AI Execution Record Specification) is an open, vendor-neutral cognitive infrastructure standard for immutable execution records across agentic, autonomous, and hybrid AI systems.

The specification defines a minimal, framework-neutral model for recording, correlating, and verifying intelligent execution events across heterogeneous environments, including multi-agent systems, robotics, distributed AI, and hybrid human–AI workflows.

AERS is not an observability tool, logging format, or tracing framework.  
It is a foundational execution record layer designed for long-term interoperability, lineage tracking, and governance of intelligent systems.

## Scope

AERS provides a standardised structure for:

- Human → AI interactions
- AI → AI coordination
- AI → Human outputs
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Autonomous and embodied system execution
- Hybrid cognitive workflows

The specification is cognition-neutral and supports:

- Statistical AI systems
- Symbolic AI systems
- Hybrid cognitive architectures
- Future cognition paradigms

---

## Positioning

AERS functions as a **Cognitive Infrastructure Layer** for intelligent systems, enabling:

- Immutable execution lineage
- Cross-provider interoperability
- Long-term auditability of AI behaviour
- Neutral execution trace standardisation
- Future-ready autonomous system governance

---

## Status

Specification Status: **Experimental (v0.x)**  
Stability Goal: Long-term semantic consistency over rapid iteration.
