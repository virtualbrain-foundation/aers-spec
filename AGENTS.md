# AERS Core Protocol (Autonomous Contributor Grade)

Status: Experimental v0.x

## Mission

Define a framework-neutral Cognitive Infrastructure Layer for recording AI and hybrid organism execution traces.

## Autonomous Contributor Doctrine

This repository is designed for:

- Human contributors
- AI agents
- Hybrid human-AI contributors

All contributors must:

- Preserve neutrality
- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Maintain schema stability
- Think in evolutionary terms (v0.x → v1 → vN)

## Core Constraints

- Framework neutral
- Cognition neutral (symbolic, neural, hybrid, theoretical)
- Industry neutral
- Planet/environment neutral (earth, space, simulation)

## Conceptual Model

AERS = Cognitive DNA
Each record = Execution Cell
Cells combine into Organisms (workflows, agents, systems)

## Architectural Rules

- Immutable execution records
- Append-only lineage
- Verifiable integrity (hash-ready)
- Extensible annotations layer

## Prohibited Patterns

- Framework-specific schemas
- Closed ecosystem assumptions
- Vendor-specific terminology

## Future Compatibility

Must support:

- Robotics autonomy
- Human-AI collaboration
- Multi-agent ecosystems
- Quantum cognition extensions (future)
