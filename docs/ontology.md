# AERS Formal Ontology (Deep Layer)

Status: Experimental v0.x (Canonical Deep Spec)

## 1. Ontological Positioning

AERS defines a cognition-native execution ontology designed to model decision evolution across intelligent systems.

It supports:

- Human cognition traces
- AI cognition traces
- Hybrid organism cognition
- Autonomous multi-agent ecosystems

## 2. Core Ontological Primitives

### 2.1 Execution Record (Cell)

Atomic, immutable record of a cognitive or operational event.

Attributes:

- Actor (Human / AI / Hybrid / Autonomous)
- Intent
- Context Envelope
- Action
- Outcome
- Timestamp
- Lineage Reference

### 2.2 Actor (Entity)

Any decision-capable participant:

- Human
- AI Model
- Agent System
- Hybrid Human-AI
- Autonomous Organism

### 2.3 Lineage (Causal Chain)

A traceable sequence of Execution Records forming a decision evolution path across systems and time.

### 2.4 Organism (Agentic System)

A coordinated system composed of multiple interacting Cells (Execution Records) across workflows.

## 3. Dual-Layer Ontology Model

Formal Layer:

- Execution Record
- Actor
- Context Envelope
- Lineage

Metaphorical Layer (Cognitive DNA):

- Cell
- Entity
- Environment
- Evolution Path

## 4. Cognition Neutrality

Ontology is designed to support:

- Symbolic AI
- Statistical/Neural AI
- Hybrid systems
- Theoretical future cognition models
- Quantum-assisted cognition (future-compatible)

## 5. Environment Agnosticism

AERS ontology is environment-neutral:

- Cloud systems
- Edge devices
- Robotics platforms
- Autonomous exploration systems
- Distributed multi-agent ecosystems

## 6. Immutability + Annotation Model

Core Records:
Immutable (historical truth)

Annotations:
Mutable, layered, extensible without altering original cognitive record.
