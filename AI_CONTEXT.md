# AERS Core (Cognition-Native Context)

Status: Experimental v0.x

## What AERS Is

AERS (AI Execution Record Specification) is a Cognitive Infrastructure Layer for recording decision, execution, and interaction traces across all forms of intelligence systems.

## Intelligence Scope

Includes:

- Statistical AI (LLMs, deep learning)
- Symbolic AI
- Hybrid cognition systems
- Human-AI organisms
- Autonomous robotics
- Space-deployed agents
- Theoretical and future AI paradigms
- Quantum-assisted AI (future alignment)

## Ontological Position

Not:

- A logging framework
- An observability tool
- A model API wrapper

But:

- A protocol for cognitive traceability
- A neutral execution record specification

## Evolutionary Framing

Single Cell → Multi Cell → Cognitive Organism
(Chatbot → Agentic Workflow → Autonomous System)

## Key Neutral Axes

- Framework Neutral
- Model Neutral
- Hardware Neutral
- Cognition Neutral
- Domain Neutral

## Why This Matters

Future ecosystems will be multi-provider, multi-agent, and cross-boundary.
AERS provides durable, interoperable cognitive lineage.
